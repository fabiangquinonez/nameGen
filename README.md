### Title: Name Generator

### Business Domain: 
People will all have various needs to create names in order to name something. This could be for a personal setting, such as for use in tabletop RPGs, or it could be for naming something important such as naming a pet, baby, business, etc. Our project’s purpose is to fulfill this need that people have.

### State of the Art: 
Most popular name generators work via choosing from a list of names, often combining a random first and last name. Some create last names by concatenating two words that wouldn’t normally be considered names. There are some generators that generate names not as full words, although most of them apply many rules to how those syllables are chosen, on the more restrictive side to fit within a naming scheme for a culture the generator has been tailored for, or on the less restrictive side to force them to flow better.

### Solution Description: 
Generating names by concatenating syllables from as exhaustive of a list of english syllables we can find, with at its simplest no restrictions. We may experiment with various linguistic rules, however the general rule would be as little culling as possible. The resulting names will likely end up choppy or hard to pronounce, however those can either be excluded from use by the user, or accepted and used for the choppiness itself.
